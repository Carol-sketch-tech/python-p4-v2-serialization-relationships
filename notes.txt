SERIALIZATION AND RELATIONSHIPS 

Use SQLAlchemy-serializer to convert SQLAlchemy object with realtionships into dictionaries

Serialization is the process of converting programmatic data such as pyhton object to a sequence of bytes that can be shred with t
other programs computers or networks.

deseialization is the opposite or the reverse process of converting a sequence of byts back to programmatic data.

in our previous lession we saw how to serilize SQLAlchemy model into a dictionary.
in this lesson, well serialize models that have realtionships
we will use serilization rules to include or exclude attributes to avoid issues eith nested models and inifinite recursion.

SerializerMixin 
this is a powerful class in SQLAlchemy-Serializer that allows developwers to quickly add serilization capabilities to their
SQLAlchemy models.


when a model class inherits SerializerMixin it gaind a range of methods for serializing and deserialing data.
the methods include to_dict(), which convert the model object into a dictionary and to_json() which converts it into a JSON string.

this means that SerializerMixin simplifies th process of data serialization by adding a set of predefined mehtods to SQLAlchemy models.
developers can format these methods as neede to achieve their desired serialization format, and can use them to quicly transform complex database models into 
simpler more usable data strucutes.
